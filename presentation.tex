% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Introduction to DNS Security}

\subsection[DNS]{What is DNS?}


\subsection{How is DNS Secured}

\begin{frame}{SSL/TLS}
	Alice wishes to Start a communication with Bob.\\
	Alice already knows the Certificate Authority's Public key: $PK_{C}$\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{ A$\Rightarrow{}$B: "ClientHello" // Initiate exchange} 
		\item{ B$\Rightarrow{}$A: $PK_{B}$ signed by $PK_{C}$ // Send the certificate}
		\item{ A$\Rightarrow{}$B: $E(PK_{B}$, NONCE) // Sends a key for the stream cipher } 
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Certificate Authorities}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DNSSEC}
\end{frame}

\section{DNS Adversary Model}

\subsection{The Byzentine Generals Problem}

\begin{frame}{Key Exchange is Key}

	The most vulnerable point in secure commnuication is exchanging keys.\\
	With only symetric encyrption, if the adversery sees your key:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{The adversary can read all messages}
		\item{The adversary can send false messages}
	\end{itemize}
	With asymetric encryption, if the adversary can intercept and replace messages from both parties:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{The adversary can read all messages}
		\item{The adversary can send false messages}
		\item{The adversary can block legitimate message}
	\end{itemize}
	Asymetric encryption just makes it more difficult to intercept communication, not impossible

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Trusted Third Parties solve everything}

	If both parties have a secure connection to a trusted third party:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{The third party can be used to verify each other's keys}
		\item{The third party can be used to detect attempted attacks}
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{CAs breached}

	2010: VeriSign CA breached
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Kept secret untill 2012}
		\item{Full impact not known}
	\end{itemize}
	2011: DigiNotar CA breached
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Redirected 300,000 Iranian IP addresses using a fraudulent SSL certificate for google.com}
	\end{itemize}
	2012: Comodo CA breached
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{85,440 forged certificates}
		\item{Deemed "To big to fail" and keys were not revoked}
	\end{itemize}
	2012-Now: Possible systemic NSA interception of SSL traffic

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The problems with CAs}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Certificate Authorities get breached}
		\item{Certificate Authorities are not inclined to tell us when they are breached. Because they lose money.}
		\item{Certificate Authorities are disinclined to revoke compromised keys}
		\item{Local goverments have power over Certificate Authortites that secure other contries traffic.}
	\end{itemize}

	The bottom line: Certificate Authorties are not giving us security

\end{frame}

\section{Proof of Work Chain based Key Distribution}

\begin{frame}{What is a Proof of Work}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Cryptographic Hash functions are designed to make it hard to find two strings which hash to the same value.}
		\item{Our best stratagy to find hash collisions is random guessing.}
		\item{By allowing for partial matches, we can create a challenge with variable difficulty that is quick to check.}
		\item{We can create a string which acts as proof somebody spend time finding a hash collison.}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How does Bitcoin Work?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{The bitcoin protocol is centered around maintaing a global state called a "blockchain"}
		\item{This state is a list of every transaction ever made."}
		\item{Periodically, a new block of signed transactions with a proof of work is added}
		\item{The longer this chain becomes, the more difficult it is to falsify}
	\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A New SSL Protocol}
	Alice wishes to Start a communication with Bob.\\
	Alice has setup a CA with Public key: $PK_{C}$\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{ A$\Rightarrow{}CA: E(PK_{CA}, NONCE_{CA})|E(PK_{CA},E(NONCE_{CA},B))$ // Send an encrypted message to the CA with B's info}
		\item{ CA$\Rightarrow{}B: E( NONCE_{CA}, PK_{B})$ // CA returns B's public key} 
		\item{ A$\Rightarrow{}B: E(PK_{B}, NONCE_{B})$ //Setup a session key with B}
	\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Modifcations to Bitcoin for a key exchange}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Rather than store a list of monitary transactions, we store a list of the ownership and transactions of names}
	\item{Limit the length of the blockchain to 1 year}
	\item{Add a 'physical' layer check to authenticate new transactions}
	\item{Consider alternative incentive methods}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Future Research Directions}

\begin{frame}{Research Directions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Imropoved SSL}
	\item{New DNS distribution Options}
	\item{Improved Software Lisensing}
	\item{Greater avalibility of PGP style messaging}
	\item{Just about anything that needs a key exchange}
	
\end{itemize}
